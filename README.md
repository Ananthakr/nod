## Description

When running larger meetings in Google Meet, it can be difficult to gauge real-time feedback as you are speaking.

A simple nod in a meeting is something we take for granted but with many team members muted or observing silently, getting this type of feedback can be tough.

Nod allows team members to send real-time reactions to presenters and speakers during meetings on Google Meet.
